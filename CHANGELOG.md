# Changelog

## Next version

### 🚀 New

* [#117](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/117) Added a ``WebsocketServer`` class to implement a pass-through websocket client-server connection to the AMQP exchange.


## 2.0.2 - May 24, 2023

### 🔧 Fixed

* Prevent commands sends to the CLU CLI to block until finished.


## 2.0.2b1 - May 23, 2023

### ⚙️ Engineering

* Remove pin on `setuptools` version.


## 2.0.1 - March 12, 2023

### 🚀 New

* Added `AMQPClient.add_reply_callback()` which allows to register callback functions that are called with an `AMQPReply` object every time a reply is received. These replies are not filtered and the callback is called for each valid reply.


## 2.0.0 - March 10, 2023

### 💥 Breaking changes

* By default `AMQPClient.send_command()` will await the command itself when the method is awaited. This means that `cmd = await client.send_command('my_actor', 'ping')` will await until the `ping` finishes and the replies are received. The previous behaviour can be forced with `await_command=False`, e.g., `cmd = await (await client.send_command('my_actor', 'ping', await_command=False))`. In general this should not be a breaking change since awaiting a done command will return immediately, but it's marked as breaking since in some corner cases there could be some unexpected behaviour.

### ✨ Improved

* Added an `internal` argument in `CluCommand` that marks the received command as internal.
* Bump `unclick` to `0.1.0b4`.

### 🏷️ Changed

* When a command status changes to running, the status is emitted as internal.


## 2.0.0b2 - March 10, 2023

### 🔧 Fixed

* Fixed asserting of `command_id` and `user_id` in testing module.


## 2.0.0b1 - March 10, 2023

### 💥 Breaking changes

* Removed support for Python 3.7.

### 🚀 New

* Support Python 3.11.
* Use `aio_pika>=9.0.0` and `aiormq>=6.6.4`.
* Support internal replies that are not shown in the CLI. Modified some command to use internal replies.
* Added `get-command-model` command that uses [unclick](https://github.com/albireox/unclick) to return a JSON representation of a command or the entire command parser. This can be used to create a programmatic API that interfaces with an actor using command strings.
* Allow to filter by actor(s) in the CLI.

### ⚙️ Engineering

* Added `MessageCode` enumeration.


## 1.9.2 - January 24, 2022

### ✨ Improved

* The `click` context object can now be access as `Command.context` if the `click` parser is being used.


## 1.9.1 - December 2, 2022

### 🔧 Fixed

* Deal with replies without value in `MockReplyList`.


## 1.9.0 - October 19, 2022

### 🚀 New

* [#111](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/111) If a `LegacyActor` uses the Click parser, and a connection to Tron is defined, adds a `tron-reconnect` command that can be used to force recreating the connection from the actor to Tron.

### 🔧 Fixed

* Avoid setting the event loop on init in `CallbackMixIn`. This caused the event loop to not be running in some cases when `notify()` was invoked.
* Reworked how `TronConnection` uses the reconnecting protocol so that it actually reconnects.


## 1.8.2 - September 15, 2022

### 🔧 Fixed

* [#110](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/110) If the content of a keyword in `LegacyActor` is empty, output the keyword without the equal sign (e.g., `test` instead of `test=`).


## 1.8.1 - September 1, 2022

### 💥 Breaking changes

* Removed the `create_setup.py` file. Poetry should now support all its use-cases.

### 🚀 New

* Added a `KeywordStore` that stores each time a keyword was output. It can be enabled by passing ``store=True`` when instantiating an actor and accessed as ``actor.store``. See the documentation for more details.
* Added `cancel_command()`, `get_current_command_name()`, and `get_current_command_name()` to click parser.


## 1.7.0 - August 14, 2022

### 💥 Breaking changes

* The client model for an actor is now updated if the actor outputs a property that is not in its schema. This is not necessarily a breaking change, but it modifies the expectation that the client will validate replies against the actor schema. With this change we indicate that validating and respecting its own schema is a task for the actor and not for the client. There are at least a couple cases for which having the client enforce the actor schema was problematic: if the actor has `patternProperties` those are legal properties but are not updated in the client model; and if the actor decides to output a non-validated message. With this change, if the client receives a property that is not in the actor schema, a new `Property` is created int eh actor `Model` and its value is updated. That `Property` has `Property.in_schema=False` to indicate that the property has not been validated. Note that this change does not affect the `TronConnection` models since those are defined by actorkeys.

### 🚀 New

* `Command.write()` can now be called with a `logging` level instead of a string message code. For example `Command.write(logging.DEBUG, text="Hi")` is equivalent to `Command.write("d", text="Hi")`.

### 🔧 Fixed

* Fixed a `ConnectionResetError` when closing the connection to a `TCPStreamServer`.


## 1.6.2 - May 25, 2022

### ✨ Improved

* The commander of a command sent to Tron is now `actor.actor` by default, instead of `actor.actor.target_actor`.
* Trying to change the status of a done command will issue a `CluWarning` and return, instead of raising a `RuntimeError`.

### 🔧 Fixed

* Prompted by [COS-74](https://jira.sdss.org/browse/COS-74), it was possible for a reply from a command with the same MID but different commander to be processed and mark a running command as complete. Now we are checking now only the MID but the commander as well.


## 1.6.1 - May 11, 2022

### 🚀 New

* New `Command.child_command()` method that allows to run a child command in the same actor already running `Command`. The practical effect is to run another of the same actor's commands as if it were part of the current `Command`.

### ✨ Improved

* Allow AMQP clients to listen to their own replies. This allows an actor sending a command to itself to know when the command is done.
* `Command.send_command()` now accepts a `new_command` argument. When `new_command=True`, the new command will receive a new command ID and the commander ID will be the actor running the command (to all effects this is equivalent to `BaseClient.send_command()`). If `new_command=False`, the command ID and commander of the current actor will be used. In this case, and if the target actor is the same actor running the current command, consider using `Command.child_command()` instead.


## 1.6.0 - April 25, 2022

### 🚀 New

* Actors can use `set_message_processor()` to set a function that will receive the message dictionary before being output to the users and can make modification on before it's emitted. This is useful, for example, to improve compatibility in actors that can be run as legacy or AMQP actors.

### 🧱 Support

* Relax sdsstools dependency to `>=0.4.13`. This is desirable since sdsstools is not yet at the 1.0 level and minor version changes block poetry.


## 1.5.8 - February 10, 2022

### 🔧 Fixed

* [#107](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/107) Add an alias `Reply.body` to `Reply.message` to allow backwards compatibility.


## 1.5.7 - February 5, 2022

### ✨ Improved

* `Command.replies` is now a list of `Reply` instances with a ``get`` method. Replies are unified for all kinds of clients.


## 1.5.6 - January 6, 2022

### 🚀 New

* [#106](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/106) `Command` now accepts a `time_limit` argument that will mark it as `TIMED_OUT` and done after an interval. `time_limit` can also be passed to `send_command()`.

### ✨ Improved

* `Command.actor` is always typed as an actor type.


## 1.5.5 - December 14, 2021

### 🚀 New

* Added a `FakeCommand` that writes to the log and that can be used when a command may not be present.

### ✨ Improved

* [#104](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/104) The existing `@cancellable` decorator did not work in subcommands. The decorator has been removed and now it's possible to pass `cancellable=True` to the command decorator (e.g., `@command.parser.command(cancellable=True)`). This takes care of adding a `--stop` option to the command. The underlying behaviour of command cancellation has not changed.


## 1.5.4 - November 26, 2021

### 🔧 Fixed

* Do not try to update model when a keyword from Tron cannot be parsed.


## 1.5.3 - November 26, 2021

### 🔧 Fixed

* Do not use a task to update the model. This caused failures when messges where being sent from a function called with an executor.


## 1.5.2 - November 7, 2021

### 🔧 Fixed

* Fixed a bug in which commanders with multiple dot-separated components would not be correctly interpreted by `handle_reply()` and the CLI.
* Command code `e` does not fail the command. This prevents cases of finishing/failing the command after it has already been failed.
* Improved the performance of the CLI by outputting all the parts of the message at once.


## 1.5.1 - November 6, 2021

### 🚀 New

* Support Python 3.10.

### ✨ Improved

* [#101](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/101) The legacy actor now accepts command strings with a commander id (e.g., `APO.Jose 10 status`). The commander id is stored in the `Command` object. Added a `Command.send_command()` that will call the remote command propagating the commander ID. For example, if a command has commander `APO.Jose` and sends a command to `guider`, the `guider` actor will receive a command with commander `APO.Jose.guider`.
* [#102](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/102) When calling a model or property callback, ensure that the arguments sent are a frozen copy of the state of the model/property at the time of the callback. This prevents that if a model is updated twice in quick succession, the callback may receive only the second value. A consequence of this change is that the model callback now receives a flattened dictionary with all the model keywords as the first argument.
* If not specified, a message with code `e` or `f`, or an exception, will use the keyword `error`.


## 1.5.0 - October 12, 2021

### ✨ Improved

* [#99](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/99) Add `exception_module` value to the output of an exception.
* [sdss/sdsstools#29](https://github.com/sdss/sdsstools/issues/29) Allow to pass a custom PyYAML loader in `from_config()` that will be forwarded to `read_yaml_file()`.
* Actors now accept `<actor> --help` with the same result as `<actor> help`.
* Add `additional_properties` parameter to `LegacyActor`.
* When a legacy actor starts, if there is a `TronConnection` available it will try to send a `hub startNubs <actor>` to initiate the connection.

### 🔧 Fixed

* Use `clu.client` for `TronConnection.send_command()`.
* If a command in a `LegacySurvey` actor is left running after the client closes the connection, it would still try to output messages to it, causing a `socket.send() raised exception` error. Now if the client exists the command continues running, but outputs to that client are ignored.


## 1.4.0 - September 27, 2021

### 🚀 New

* [#98](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/98) Add `unique()` and `cancellable()` decorators for Click command parsers.

### ✨ Improved

* [#95](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/95) Cast all arguments to string in `ProxyClient.send_command()`.
* Add `get_keys` parameter to `LegacyActor.start()` that is passed to `TronConnection.start()`
* Use `.client` as default commander for `TronConnection` and `{actor}.{target}` for actor.

### 🔧 Fixed

* Avoid and error in the callback when a connection to the TCP server is closed.


## 1.3.0 - September 17, 2021

### 💥 Breaking changes

* [#86](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/86) `additionalProperties` is set to `false` by default if not specified, including if `schema=None` when initialising an actor.

### 🚀 New

* [#85](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/85) Added `BaseClient.proxy()` method.

### ✨ Improved

* [#90](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/90) If an exception object is passed as a keyword in a command or actor message, it will be unpacked into the exception type and message.
* Make the error output when a reply fails to validate more clear.

### 🔧 Fixed

* [#91](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/91) Documentation example for testing with CLU.

### 🧹 Cleanup

* Add `invoke_mock_command()` stub method to `BaseClient` to simplify type checking.


## 1.2.1 - June 20, 2021

### 🚀 New

* [#89](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/89) Use [furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/) Sphinx theme.

### 🔧 Fixed

* `LegacyActor` now accepts the `config` parameter sent by `from_config()`.

### ✨ Improved

* Subcommands now won't write to the users when they start running.


## 1.2.0 - June 3, 2021

### 🚀 New

* `Command` and `BaseActor.write()` now accept a `silent` argument that if `True` will execute the command normally and update the status and internal model, but won't write to the user. Timed command can be run in silent mode the first iteration by initialising them with `first_silent=True`.

### ✨ Improved

* [#77](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/77) Child commands will never emit ``:`` or ``f`` messages that may be confused as the parent being done.
* Timed commands are run immediately when started.
* `from_config()` now passes the configuration to the client `__init__()` so that it is accessible during initialisation.
* If a timed command takes longer to run than the interval at which the poller checks if new timed commands should be run, prevent it from being issued multiple times.


## 1.1.2 - May 31, 2021

### 🔧 Fixed

* Revert previous changes to the typing of `Command` that were causing problems, but keep the generic for the command future.


## 1.1.1 - May 30, 2021

### 🔧 Fixed

* Correctly assign the type of the actor in a `Command`.
* Fix error when `TopicListener.stop()` is called and there is not an active connection.

### ✨ Improved

* `Device.start()` now returns `self`.
* [#84](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/84) `send_command` now accepts multiple arguments before the keyword arguments. If they are passed, they will be concatenated to create the full command string. For example: `client.send_command('my_actor', 'sum', '-v', 2, 4, command_id=5)` is equivalent to `client.send_command('my_actor', 'sum -v 2 4', command_id=5)`


## 1.1.0 - May 29, 2021

### 🚀 New

* [#82](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/82) `send_command` now accepts a `callback` argument. If set, the callback will be called each time the actor replies and will receive the reply itself (`AMQPReply` in case of `AMQPClient/Actor` and `clu.legacy.types.messages.Reply` for `Tron/TronConnection`). Thanks to Florian Briegel for the idea.

### ✨ Improved

* [#81](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/81) Improve typing of `BaseCommand` and command replies.
* In `TronConnection`, do not fail with a `ParseError` if one of the keywords cannot be parsed. Instead, issue a warning and move on to the next one.
* The CLI now checks that the preferred style (`solarized-dark`) is available. Otherwise defaults to `pygments` default style.
* Copy `Property` before notifying the callbacks. This prevents the value passed being updated in the time that it takes for the callback to go out.
* `Property`, `BaseModel`, and `TronModel` now have a `last_seen` attribute that is updated with the Unix time when the model or property/key are updated.
* When the AMQP client is handling replies for a command, it will update the status every time it changes, not only when it is done or failed.
* `StatusCommand` callbacks now receive the status itself as an argument.


## 1.0.3 - May 20, 2021

### ✨ Improved

* When tracking the status of a command sent to Tron, update the status with each received reply, and store all the replies.
* When `as_complete_failer` cancels the tasks after an exception, suppress all possible exceptions, not only `CancelledError`, since the original exception will be raised again. Add tests for `as_complete_failer`.


## 1.0.2 - May 18, 2021

### 🔧 Fixed

* [#78](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/78) Fixes a bug in which an actor with a defined `TronConnection` that had failed to start would still try to send commands to Tron.

### ✨ Improved

* [#79](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/79) `TronConnection` now uses a `ReconnectingTCPClientProtocol` that will try to keep the socket to Tron open, allowing Tron to restart without losing connection.

### 🧹 Cleanup

* `releases` was misbehaving once we reached `1.x`, and its interpretation of semantic versioning was a bit too extreme. Instead, we are now using a Markdown file with `myst-parser`. The previous changelog is still available [here](https://clu.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.1/changelog.html).


## 1.0.1 - May 16, 2021

### ✨ Improved

* `BaseActor` receives a `validate` parameter that can be used to globally define whether the actor should validate its own messages against the model.


## 1.0.0 - May 12, 2021

### 🚀 New

* Transition CLU to stable!

### 🧹 Cleanup

* Upgrade `click` to `^8.0.0`.
