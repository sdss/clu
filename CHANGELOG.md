# Changelog

## Next version

### ðŸš€ New

* `Command` and `BaseActor.write()` now accept a `silent` argument that if `True` will execute the command normally and update the status and internal model, but won't write to the user. Timed command can be run in silent mode the first iteration by initialising them with `first_silent=True`.

### âœ¨ Improved

* [#77](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/77) Child commands will never emit ``:`` or ``f`` messages that may be confused as the parent being done.
* Timed commands are run immediately when started.


## 1.1.2 - May 31, 2021

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

* Revert previous changes to the typing of `Command` that were causing problems, but keep the generic for the command future.


## 1.1.1 - May 30, 2021

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

* Correctly assign the type of the actor in a `Command`.
* Fix error when `TopicListener.stop()` is called and there is not an active connection.

### âœ¨ Improved

* `Device.start()` now returns `self`.
* [#84](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/84) `send_command` now accepts multiple arguments before the keyword arguments. If they are passed, they will be concatenated to create the full command string. For example: `client.send_command('my_actor', 'sum', '-v', 2, 4, command_id=5)` is equivalent to `client.send_command('my_actor', 'sum -v 2 4', command_id=5)`


## 1.1.0 - May 29, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* [#82](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/82) `send_command` now accepts a `callback` argument. If set, the callback will be called each time the actor replies and will receive the reply itself (`AMQPReply` in case of `AMQPClient/Actor` and `clu.legacy.types.messages.Reply` for `Tron/TronConnection`). Thanks to Florian Briegel for the idea.

### âœ¨ Improved

* [#81](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/81) Improve typing of `BaseCommand` and command replies.
* In `TronConnection`, do not fail with a `ParseError` if one of the keywords cannot be parsed. Instead, issue a warning and move on to the next one.
* The CLI now checks that the preferred style (`solarized-dark`) is available. Otherwise defaults to `pygments` default style.
* Copy `Property` before notifying the callbacks. This prevents the value passed being updated in the time that it takes for the callback to go out.
* `Property`, `BaseModel`, and `TronModel` now have a `last_seen` attribute that is updated with the Unix time when the model or property/key are updated.
* When the AMQP client is handling replies for a command, it will update the status every time it changes, not only when it is done or failed.
* `StatusCommand` callbacks now receive the status itself as an argument.


## 1.0.3 - May 20, 2021

### âœ¨ Improved

* When tracking the status of a command sent to Tron, update the status with each received reply, and store all the replies.
* When `as_complete_failer` cancels the tasks after an exception, suppress all possible exceptions, not only `CancelledError`, since the original exception will be raised again. Add tests for `as_complete_failer`.


## 1.0.2 - May 18, 2021

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

* [#78](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/78) Fixes a bug in which an actor with a defined `TronConnection` that had failed to start would still try to send commands to Tron.

### âœ¨ Improved

* [#79](https://github.com/sdss/clu/issues/79) `TronConnection` now uses a `ReconnectingTCPClientProtocol` that will try to keep the socket to Tron open, allowing Tron to restart without losing connection.

### ðŸ§¹ Cleanup

* `releases` was misbehaving once we reached `1.x`, and its interpretation of semantic versioning was a bit too extreme. Instead, we are now using a Markdown file with `myst-parser`. The previous changelog is still available [here](https://clu.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.1/changelog.html).


## 1.0.1 - May 16, 2021

### âœ¨ Improved

* `BaseActor` receives a `validate` parameter that can be used to globally define whether the actor should validate its own messages against the model.


## 1.0.0 - May 12, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* Transition CLU to stable!

### ðŸ§¹ Cleanup

* Upgrade `click` to `^8.0.0`.
