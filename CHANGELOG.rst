Changelog
=========

* :feature:`18` Allow to pass a command parser that inherits from `.CluGroup` and autocomplete ``help`` and ``ping`` if needed.

* :release:`0.2.0 <2020-01-19>`
* :feature:`21` Renamed ``Command.done`` and ``.failed`` to `.Command.finish` and `.Command.fail`.
* Allow to define the default keyword to use if a message is just a string.
* `.Command.finish` and `.Command.fail` now return the command itself. This is useful when doing ``return command.fail()`` in case the user wants to do something else with the command.

* :release:`0.1.12 <2020-01-14>`
* Some tweaks to `.JSONActor` and the testing framework.
* Added an error reply level.

* :release:`0.1.11 <2020-01-14>`
* Remove numpy dependency from CLU.
* Improve logging to actor.
* Use `~unittest.mock.AsyncMock` in the ``testing`` module when running Python 3.8+.
* Improve representation of actor classes (print name of class as ``repr``).
* Simplify ``from_config`` by taking advantage that one can pass arguments as keyword arguments and does not need to conserve the original order. This allows to define only `.BaseClient.from_config` and do not need to override it of each subclass.
* Add a `.JSONActor` class that replies to the user using JSON dictionaries.
* Move ``parser`` argument from `.BaseClient` to `.BaseActor`, since only actors receive and need to parse commands.
* Rename `Actor <.AMQPActor>` to `.AMQPActor`.

* :release:`0.1.10 <2019-12-25>`
* Tweak dependencies and poetry install.

* :release:`0.1.9 <2019-11-21>`
* Fix ``__version__`` definition from package version.

* :release:`0.1.8 <2019-11-21>`
* Allow to pass a mapping of logging to actor codes to the `.ActorHandler`.
* Use `poetry <https://poetry.eustace.io/>`__ for development and building.

* :release:`0.1.7 <2019-11-19>`
* Added `.BaseCommand.debug`, `~.BaseCommand.info`, and `~.BaseCommand.warning` convenience methods.

* :release:`0.1.6 <2019-11-15>`
* Fix display of warnings in actor.
* In legacy actor, default to use the ``text`` keyword if the message passed is a string.
* **Breaking change:** Rename ``Client.run()`` and ``Actor.run()`` to ``.start()`` (same for legacy actor). Added a `.LegacyActor.run_forever` method for convenience.

* :release:`0.1.5 <2019-11-13>`
* :bug:`6` Fix bug when asking for help of subcommands and command groups.
* :feature:`7` Allow Tron connection to fail but keep the actor alive and working.
* :bug:`11` Allow to pass parser arguments to a `.CluGroup`.
* :bug:`8` Fix `AttributeError` when connection breaks.
* :feature:`15` Implement subcommands.

* Fix Travis deployment.

* :release:`0.1.2 <2019-10-11>`
* Allow to pass the command parser as an argument.
* Make sure help command finishes.
* Modify legacy command parser. Now it accepts commands in the form ``<command_id> <command_body>`` (in ``tron``, this requires setting the ``ASCIICmdEncoder`` with ``useCID=False, CIDfirst=False``).
* Provide a new :ref:`clu.testing <api-testing>` module with testing tools.
* Better exception and logging handling.

* :release:`0.1.1 <2019-10-03>`
* Fix tag version.

* :release:`0.1.0 <2019-10-03>`
